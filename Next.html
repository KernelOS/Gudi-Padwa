	<h3>Why we should Stop following foreign culture?</h3>
	<p>For more than 200 years they ruled India. Our freedom fighters sacrificed their lives for Us and now-a-days What are we doing? Blindly following their culture. We shouldn't forget sacrifice of our freedom fighters. We should stop following their culture because Joint family culture is declined day by day and nuclear family taken its place. Western food is replacing Indian Food which has increased the rate of obesity in India. Westernization is a curse in disguise. Mounting western culture is degrading the Indian culture. Western Influence is rising on the Indian Society every year.  Western culture is gradually increasing in cities and soon it will reach to other places in India. There is nothing wrong to learn and know about others culture but blindly following something is dangerous.<br>Now-a-days western society is adopting our culture and values because they also know their culture is of no use and worth going in dustbin.</p>
	<h3>Why we should follow Indian culture?</h3>
	<p>We should be proud of our culture.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Indian culture which is one of the oldest and richest culture.</li>
		<li>Indian culture is all about joint family.</li>
		<li>Indian Food is good for our health.</li>
		<li>Indian culture is Deeply spiritual.</li>
		<li>Indian culture is all about caring and loving each other.</li>
